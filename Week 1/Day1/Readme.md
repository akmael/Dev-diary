Reflect:
Im enjoying the challenge so far.

My learning style of watch and apply should work just fine, probably will need to
take notes soon.


Review:

No questions as of yet

git stauts: gives the status of local repo and weather it has changed or not

git add: gets local repo updated

get commit: commits local changes to git hub

cd: change directory

ls: list out the current directory

mkdir: makes a new folder

touch: makes a new file
