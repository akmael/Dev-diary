Reflect:
Answer the following
questions:

1.This class can be difficult
at times, how does it
compare to the things
that you have done
before?

Compared to learning on the job by myself with hard deadlines and very little support
this class is easier

Compared to taking an advanced web course at Santa Fe,this class is way more thorough.

2. We all have our own ideas
and ways that we prefer
to accomplish tasks, how
do you think that people
would fair if the class was
run the way you prefer

I like how this class is run, I have nothing to add.

Review:
Describe, in words not code,
how you would accomplish
each of the following:

1. Add a mouseenter event
handler to every anchor
tag on the page that
changes the text size.

I would use a Query to select all the anchor tags and assign them to a variable
once that is complete I would build a for loop to move through the collection
and use the styles method to change the css associated with each anchor element


2. Add a user login page to
your website so that
people only see the pages
you want them to see.

have a seperate page for login and using javascript collect the info of the person
logging in. if their info matches a know user then redirect the user to there account page.
Else let them know that either they don't have an account or that there credentials were incorrect 


3. Position an image in the
center of the page.

bootstrap
